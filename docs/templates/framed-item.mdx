title: Framed Item Gallery
---
`modopedia:framed_item`

---

## Description
An **[Item Gallery](../page_components/item-gallery)** with a **[Small Frame](../page_components/small-frame)**. This template is placed so that the item gallery is at (0, 0), and the frame is automatically spaced to fit that.

<Callout variant="warning">
    A framed item gallery technically can render multiple item lists, but it is not supposed to. There will only be a frame on the first one.
</Callout>

## JSON Schema

<Callout variant="warning">
    Changing `width` will not scale the size of the frame widgets, it will only change the size of the gallery itself. If you want a different sized frame, you'll have to make one yourself.
