# Description

Modopedia is a resource-driven guidebook and in-game documentation mod for Minecraft available on Neoforge and Fabric featuring an extensive API and a wide range of out-of-the-box content. The keen eyed among you may be thinking "Well, isn't this just Patchouli?". No! Modopedia sports numerous API improvements for mod developers and gives much more freedom in creating customised content, such as:

* Customisable textures, including the dimensions and number of pages. You control almost everything about how the book renders.

* Ability to quickly find the page for a specific item using the "Study" key with no extra setup.

* JSON format supporting circular dependencies and multiple categories per entry.

* Clear error handling on a per-component level. No more nuking the entire entry!

* Multiple templates on a single page.

* And much, much more!

# Support Development

Modopedia has taken many hours of my time and was made possible by the wonderful modding community and players of my other mod, Enchanted: Witchcraft. I greatly appreciate any support and feedback. If you would like to help buy new assets for Modopedia and my other projects, show some appreciation or fund my crippling potion addiction, then consider supporting me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/favouriteless).

# Documentation
Modopedia's Entry JSONs are slightly less abstracted than most other book mods. Rather than working with pages, you place components either directly or by using templates. While this does take a little effort to set up initially, it provides far more extensive customisability than alternatives like Patchouli.

The [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Favouriteless/Modopedia/wiki) can be used to view how to create books and integrate with your own mods, if something isn't covered or you need help you can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/UkVgJ9nb5y) and ask in there.

# FAQs

- **Can I add this to my modpack?** - Of course! Just please don't redistribute the mod elsewhere without asking me first and don't claim credit for creating it.
- **Can you add X thing?** - Feel free to leave suggestions on the discord. I read and consider all feedback.
